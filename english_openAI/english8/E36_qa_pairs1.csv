"1. What actions can the Collector take after the expiry of a lease or mortgage period according to the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, especially in cases where the occupancy vests in the State Government and needs to be disposed of? How does the Code address damages for the use and occupation of occupancies in certain cases, particularly in relation to Tribal-transferors who may have unlawfully transferred their land?","After the expiry of a lease or mortgage period, the Collector, according to the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, can take the following actions:

1. The Collector may restore possession of the occupancy to the Tribal, either suo motu or on application made by the Tribal.

Regarding damages for the use and occupation of occupancies in certain cases, the Code addresses this by invalidating any transfer made in contravention of the law.

How can the Collector restore possession to the Tribal in cases where an occupancy has been transferred unlawfully, and what is the process for the Tribal-transferor to purchase the land at the prescribed purchase price?","The Collector is not bound by any existing laws, court decrees, or awards when it comes to restoring possession of occupancies that have been transferred unlawfully in contravention of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code.
