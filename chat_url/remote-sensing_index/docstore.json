This platform enables all the NIC officers to access and integrate map services in their e-Gov application. Map services are being provided to various Ministries and Departments like the Ministry of Sanitation and Drinking Water for SBM (Gramin), Drinking Water Portal etc. Similar services are being provided to the Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Urban Development, Department of Land Resources, Department of Labour, Vahan & Sarathi projects, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Health Management Information System (HMIS) etc. \n(c) Geocoding and Reverse geocoding services  Geocoding is the process of transforming a description of a location such as a pair of coordinates, an address and name of a place to a location on the earth\u2019s surface. NIC has incorporated three geocoding options on Bharat Maps \u2013 NIC Place Locator, Pin code Locator and ESRI World Geocoder. \n(d) NIC Satellite Imagery  Satellite imagery is one valid source of latest location information, and therefore, having its base map service is of added advantage for visualization and verifying data. As a part of the \u201cUpscaling of Multi-layer GIS Framework\u201d project, it was required to create in-house and high resolution national image services for upgrading the existing selected GIS layers to 1:10,000 scale and encourage its use in various e-Gov applications instead of the external services like Google, Bing etc.\nGIS platform, established by National Informatics Centre (NIC), using NICMAPS services, has been revamped as \u2018BHARAT MAPS\u2019. It depicts the core foundation data as an integrated multi-scale, multi-resolution base map service using reference data from various agencies.  \n\n\nNIC\u2019s Multi-Layer GIS Platform, Bharat Maps defines such a multi-scale and multi-resolution service-oriented framework, which is leveraging even API based OGC compliant (WMS, WFS etc.) Map Services to get integrated with e-Governance workflows associated with flagship programmes of the Government such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Schools, Telecom, Health, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, Roads and Agriculture. It is an essential component of Digital India program to ensure easy, effective and economical governance. It also provides GIS based decision support system to Central and State Government Departments for delivering citizen centric services.\nFor more details please visit: https://bharatmaps.gov.in/\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Last Updated Date  :April 28th, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter", "start_char_idx": 7, "end_char_idx": 4232, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a2bbe7c-4743-4ca8-a535-b3bfc02d4d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a2bbe7c-4743-4ca8-a535-b3bfc02d4d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/remote-sensing-gis/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/remote-sensing-gis/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/remote-sensing-gis/"}, "hash": "e495e70356a80cc8174050cef09ac231e4e533290079566964f68a67d8090415", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "07e06f68-cb92-4e2b-ba21-f220b61d4296", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/remote-sensing-gis/"}, "hash": "ed4a3e2cc05a0b00b29b05f399f79c4ba1796f70e8706972ca7fe6d921094811", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "NIC\u2019s Multi-Layer GIS Platform, Bharat Maps defines such a multi-scale and multi-resolution service-oriented framework, which is leveraging even API based OGC compliant (WMS, WFS etc.) Map Services to get integrated with e-Governance workflows associated with flagship programmes of the Government such as Swachh Bharat Mission, Schools, Telecom, Health, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, Roads and Agriculture.
