The Aadhaar numbers are encrypted using keys specifically created for the purpose in intrusion-resistant FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Certified Hardware Security Module (HSM).\n\n\n\nThe ADV stores Aadhaar numbers collected by an e-governance applications in a secure encrypted database separate from user application database. Each Aadhaar Number is mapped to a Reference Key, which is returned to the user application for storing in place of the Aadhaar number and this reference key is used for delivery of Aadhaar based services.\n\n\nSalient Features\n\n\n*Secure Dedicated Storage\n*Robust Key Management Solution including Automated Key Migration\n*High Availability\n*Highly Scalable\n*Bulk Tokenization and De-Tokenization\n*Intrinsic Aadhaar de-duplication\n*FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM devices\n*Multi-Layer Security architecture\n*REST APIs based seamless integration with applications\n\n\n\nCentral Govt. and State Govt. Ministries, Departments, Organizations availing IT services from NIC and having their servers hosted on NICNET may avail Aadhaar Data Vault Service.\n\nFor more details please contact at :  support-edmsd[at]nic[dot]in\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Last Updated Date  :February 27th, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this website\nTerms of use\nWebsite policies\nSitemap\nHelp\nContact Us\nFeedback\nWeb Information Manager\nCISO\nRecruitment\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Content Owned and Maintained by National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) | Government of India\n   Website is Designed, Developed and Hosted by National Informatics Centre,  Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) | Government of India\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nLast Updated: May 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror: Content is protected !!", "start_char_idx": 7, "end_char_idx": 4087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/centralised-aadhaar-vault/": {"node_ids": ["3bac1262-bd37-4cf1-a665-94b38234ccca"], "metadata": {"URL": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/centralised-aadhaar-vault/"}}}}
