SaaS is a software delivery model where users are not responsible for supporting the application or any of the components. The server infrastructure, OS and software is being managed by cloud services.\nContainer as a Services \u2013 NCCaaS is a highly scalable, high\u00ac-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications.\nArtificial Intelligence as a Service \u2013 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human cognitive processes by machines. For this machine learns from data both structured and unstructured. AI models can be built using supervised learning, or semi-supervised learning, where the system can be used to search for patterns in the data and cluster them, and in next stage use such classes for further model training.However usually users donot have the necessary resources to harness AI because data crunching is a computationally intensive job.\nApplication Performance Management (APM) Service \u2013 Application Performance Management (APM) provides the monitoring and management of performance, availability and user experience of software applications. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service.\nResource Monitoring as a Service \u2013 This service helps you to monitor the cloud resources utilization and its availability with allowing you to analyse the utilization trends for critical server resources like CPU, Memory, Network I/O etc. This helps you for better capacity planning and provide a better end-user experience.\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF) Service \u2013 Web Application Firewall will help you to give extra protection for HTTP / web based applications with having applied a set of rules to an HTTP conversation and cover common attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.\nData Analytics (DA) as a Service \u2013 Data Analytics as a service (DA-SaaS) refers to the provision of analytics software and operations through web-delivered technologies. These types of solutions offer businesses an alternative to developing internal hardware setups just to perform business analytics.\nData Analytics (DA) as a Service \u2013 Data Analytics as a service (DA-SaaS) refers to the provision of analytics software and operations through web-delivered technologies.
