There is a continuous need to set up strategic infrastructure that facilitates high availability, quick scalability, efficient management & optimized utilization of resources.\nTo address this ever-growing demand, National Informatics Centre (NIC) has set up state-of-the-art National Data Centres at NIC Headquarters Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar and 37 small Data Centres at various State Capitals to provide services to the Government at all levels. These Data Centres combine round-the-clock operations and management of systems with onsite skilled personnel. The National Data Centres form the core of e-Governance Infrastructure in India by providing services to various e-Governance initiatives undertaken by the Government of India.\n\nThe first Data Centre was launched in Hyderabad in 2008, followed by NDC Pune in 2010, NDC Delhi in 2011 and NDC Bhubaneshwar in 2018.\nNational Data Centre (NDC) at Bhubaneswar is a Cloud-enabled Data Centre which has been offering cloud services to Government Departments since its inception. This NDC was setup with a state-of-the-art facility with 24X7 support, covering 40,000 square feet of area to meet the growing needs of Digital India initiatives.\nNational Data Centres at Delhi, Pune and Hyderabad were upgraded with high speed Network, 1.6 Petabyte Enterprise class storage, high throughput Network Load Balancers, and Intrusion Prevention Systems. Solution for Backup as a Service & Storage as a Service was also implemented. The ICT infrastructure of number of National Level Projects was hosted/ enhanced; which includes e-Office, e-Courts and e-Transport.\n\nThe foundation stone of first National Data Centre for the North Eastern Region (NEDC) was laid by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister at Guwahati, Assam through video conferencing in February 2021. It will have state-of-the-art network and Security Operating Centres, and the advanced facility to catalyze the digital empowerment of the region. The Network Operating Centre will monitor and manage the critical ICT infrastructure, ensuring 24\u00d77 availability of services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Last Updated Date  :March 19th, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this website\nTerms of use\nWebsite policies\nSitemap\nHelp\nContact Us\nFeedback\nWeb Information Manager\nCISO\nRecruitment\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Content Owned and Maintained by National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) | Government of India\n   Website is Designed, Developed and Hosted by National Informatics Centre,  Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) | Government of India\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nLast Updated: May 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror: Content is protected !!", "start_char_idx": 7, "end_char_idx": 4012, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/data-centre/": {"node_ids": ["ebabc91a-ca84-46f1-b0de-db6bf842cc24"], "metadata": {"URL": "https://www.nic.in/servicecontents/data-centre/"}}}}
